# dynamicPage description
This is a personal blog with php. It is using php for dynamicing the content of page. Every part like navbar, content and 
footer are a separated page  which makes it easier to change because they are all the same in other pages. 
# test code
I am running this on my local machine which it is not possible to have link here. But you can copy the code and 
if you have a apache server or others then you can test the code.
